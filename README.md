vault-rcp-ui
============

This little project provides a UI to manage vault-rcp tasks and is based on the REST API provided by vault-rcp. It utilizes the following frameworks:
- jQuery (>=1.9.0)
- Handlebars
- Twitter Bootstrap (3.2.0)

It has been developed and tested against a Apache Sling SNAPSHOT instance built from sources. Required vault-core and vault-rcp bundles from the Apache Jackrabbit FileVault project are also part of this project (3.1.7-SNAPSHOT).

===========

Fork this repository and use the vlt-cli to import the complete jcr_root to a running Sling instance.
